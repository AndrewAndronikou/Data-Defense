# Data Defense

An enjoyable project I created shortly after graduating University. All assets were created by myself (with exception to audio). 
This is a tower defense game with the following features:
* Varying levels with increasing difficulty
* 3 Turret types
* 3 Enemy types
* Shop
* Upgrading
